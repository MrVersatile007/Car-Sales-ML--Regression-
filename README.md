# Car-Sales-ML--Regression

â€˜PREDICTION OF CAR SALES USING LINEAR REGRESSION METHOD IN MACHINE LEARNING'

I used Python to this ML algorithm, in which I used potential inbuilt libraries of Python namely Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy and sklearn. The goal of this venture is to forecast the price of a used car based on its specifications. I started by cleaning the very messy data set in the first step, then pre-processed the data using several assumptions (as well as relaxing some of them), and then applied statistical concepts and standardization techniques to the pre-processed data. Later, I created a model and then filled it with dummy variables. finally I used train-test split to tranin and test my model.
